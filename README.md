## Service-Wall [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Harkishen-Singh/Service-Wall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Harkishen-Singh/Service-Wall)
Monitors process / service activities and warns on suspicious behavior
Linux has no record on how a system behaves or how to keep a record of various processes doing work in the background. 
The user has absolutely no idea of what's going on in the background.

This project aims to become the **first line of defence** for Linux Systems by acting as a smart firewall, informing the user about the activities carried out in the background away
from the easy eyes. Moreover, it analyses a process for suspicious behavior and warns the user if found any. Consequently, the 
**process / service is restricted from certain tasks**. It also keeps the user informed about the **heavy processes and advices** the user
to handle them efficiently so that the system could perform with ease.
